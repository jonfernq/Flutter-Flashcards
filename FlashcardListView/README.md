## Flashcard List View 

A flashcard app needs some way for a user to select a deck of flashcards for review.

Towards this end, a Flutter program is presented below that uses a ListView widget to display a list of flashcard sets, and prints the selected set to the console when the user taps on a button associated with that set. The program assumes that the flashcard sets are stored as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a set of flashcards, and has a name property that indicates the name of the set, and a cards property that is an array of flashcard objects.

In this program, the FlashcardSet class represents a set of flashcards, and the Flashcard class represents an individual flashcard. The FlashcardSetListPage class is a stateful widget that loads the flashcard sets from a JSON file in its initState method, and displays the sets using a ListView.builder widget in its build method. Each list item contains the flashcard set name and a button that, when pressed, displays the contents of the associated flashcard set to the console.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flashcard Sets',
      home: FlashcardSetListPage(),
    );
  }
}

class FlashcardSet {
  final String name;
  final List<Flashcard> cards;

  FlashcardSet({required this.name, required this.cards});
}

class Flashcard {
  final String front;
  final String back;

  Flashcard({required this.front, required this.back});
  
  @override
  String toString() {
       return '{front: $front, back: $back}';
  }
}

class FlashcardSetListPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FlashcardSetListPageState createState() => _FlashcardSetListPageState();
}

class _FlashcardSetListPageState extends State<FlashcardSetListPage> {
  List<FlashcardSet> _flashcardSets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Load the flashcard sets from a JSON file
    String json = '''
    [
      {
        "name": "Numbers",
        "cards": [
          {"front": "One", "back": "Uno"},
          {"front": "Two", "back": "Dos"},
          {"front": "Three", "back": "Tres"}
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Colors",
        "cards": [
          {"front": "Red", "back": "Rojo"},
          {"front": "Blue", "back": "Azul"},
          {"front": "Green", "back": "Verde"}
        ]
      }
    ]
    ''';
    List<dynamic> data = jsonDecode(json);
    _flashcardSets = data.map((set) {
      String name = set['name'];
      List<dynamic> cards = set['cards'];
      List<Flashcard> flashcards = cards.map((card) {
        String front = card['front'];
        String back = card['back'];
        return Flashcard(front: front, back: back);
      }).toList();
      return FlashcardSet(name: name, cards: flashcards);
    }).toList();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Flashcard Sets'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: _flashcardSets.length,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(_flashcardSets[index].name),
            trailing: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Print the selected flashcard set to the console
                print(_flashcardSets[index].cards);
              },
              child: Text('View'),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### How the program works 

This Flutter program is designed to display a list of flashcard sets, where each set consists of a name and a list of flashcards. The program loads the flashcard sets from a JSON file and displays them in a ListView widget using ListTile widgets. Each ListTile widget has a button that, when pressed, displays the associated flashcard set in the console.

The program consists of three classes: FlashcardSet, Flashcard, and FlashcardSetListPage. The FlashcardSet class represents a set of flashcards, and the Flashcard class represents an individual flashcard. The FlashcardSetListPage class is a stateful widget that loads the flashcard sets from a JSON file in its initState method and displays the sets using a ListView.builder widget in its build method. Each list item contains the name of the flashcard set and a button labeled "View". When the button is pressed, the associated flashcard set is printed to the console.

The program starts with the main() function, which creates an instance of the MyApp class and passes it to the runApp() function. The MyApp class is a StatelessWidget that returns a MaterialApp widget with the title "Flashcard Sets" and a home page of type FlashcardSetListPage.

The FlashcardSetListPage class is a StatefulWidget that overrides the createState() method to create an instance of the _FlashcardSetListPageState class. The _FlashcardSetListPageState class is where the flashcard sets are loaded from a JSON file using the initState() method. The JSON string is stored in a variable, and the jsonDecode() function is used to parse it into a List<dynamic> object. The List<dynamic> is then converted to a List<FlashcardSet> by mapping over each element of the list and creating a new FlashcardSet object using the data in the JSON. The resulting list is stored in the _flashcardSets field of the state object.

The build() method of the _FlashcardSetListPageState class returns a Scaffold widget with an AppBar and a body that contains a ListView.builder widget. The ListView.builder widget uses the _flashcardSets list to build a list of ListTile widgets, one for each flashcard set. Each ListTile widget displays the name of the flashcard set and has a button labeled "View" as its trailing widget. When the button is pressed, the associated flashcard set is printed to the console using the print() function.
